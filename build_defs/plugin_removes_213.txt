# TODO(b/255307289) Remove these. It may lead to problems if the collect lib in google3
# is out of sync with that in IJ.
# Note: we really want to zap c.g.c.collect.ImmutableList, but we
# can't do that alone due to package private member access to/from
# other classes in the same package. So we zap the whole package.
# Then we need to zap a few other classes to avoid LinkageErrors.
